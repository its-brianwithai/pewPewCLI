### üìÇ `pew init`

Creates the `.pew` directory and default configuration files (`.pew/config/paths.yaml`, `.pew/tasks.md`) in the current directory. It will prompt for the primary tasks file path unless `--force` is used.

```bash
# Interactive initialization
pew init

# Force initialization without prompts (uses defaults)
pew init --force
```

### üìÇ `pew paste tasks`

Reads content from your system clipboard and writes it to a task file. By default, it targets the file specified by `paste-tasks` in `paths.yaml` (or falls back to the first file under `tasks:`). You can specify the mode (`overwrite`, `append`, `insert`) or the target path using options. If no mode is specified, it will prompt interactively.

```bash
# Paste and overwrite the default task file
pew paste tasks --overwrite

# Append clipboard content to a specific file
pew paste tasks --path specific/project/tasks.md --append

# Run interactively to choose mode
pew paste tasks
```

### üëâ `pew next task`

This is the core command for progressing through your task lists. It finds the current task marked with `üëâ`, marks it as complete (`- [ ]` -> `- [x]`), removes the `üëâ`, finds the next available incomplete task (`- [ ]`) across all files configured in `paths.yaml` (in order), adds the `üëâ` prefix to it, and displays the context of that new task.

```bash
# Process the current task and move to the next one
pew next task
```

### üìÇ `pew reset tasks`

Resets completed tasks within your configured checklists. This command interactively prompts you to select which of the task files listed in your `paths.yaml` you want to reset. For each selected file, it changes all completed task markers (`- [x]` or `- [X]`) back to incomplete (`- [ ]`) and removes the `üëâ` prefix if present.

It helps restart repeatable workflows (like daily checklists, QA runs) without manual editing.

```bash
# Interactively select configured task files to reset
pew reset tasks
```

The prompt will show a summary of tasks within each file to help you select.

### ‚ú® `pew update`

Checks if a newer version of `pew-pew-cli` is available on npm and prompts you to install it if found.

```bash
# Check for and install updates
pew update
```

## üìù Pew Pipelines (`pew next task`)

You can manage different checklists across multiple files (e.g., main dev tasks, QA checklist).

1. **Configure `paths.yaml`:** List all relevant files under the `tasks:` key in order.
2. **Run `pew next task`:** pewPewCLI processes tasks sequentially through the files listed.
3. **Reset Checklists:** Use `pew reset tasks` to uncheck completed items when you want to restart a workflow (like the QA checklist).

## ü§ñ Example Agent Prompt

Here's a prompt you can adapt for an AI agent to use this tool once initialized in a project:

```
You are an AI assistant tasked with executing the next available milestones and set of tasks outlined in the provided plan. Follow these instructions carefully:

1.  **Review Task Plan:** First, carefully review the content of the {{TASK_FILE_LOCATION}} (typically `.pew/tasks.md`).

2.  **Understand Context:**
    *   Your goal is to complete the next available milestone (specifically Milestone `{{MILESTONE_NUMBER}}`) and its associated tasks sequentially.
    *   You must follow the plan exactly as specified in `{{TASK_FILE_LOCATION}}` without adding, removing, or changing steps or requirements unless explicitly instructed by a task.

3.  **Identify Next Task:**
    *   Locate Milestone `{{MILESTONE_NUMBER}}` in the `{{TASK_FILE_LOCATION}}` file.
    *   Identify the first uncompleted task listed under this milestone.
    *   Use the `pew next task` command to confirm and retrieve the details of this first task.

4.  **Research Project Context:**
    *   Based on the output of `pew next task`, thoroughly scan all related project files to gain a deep understanding of the task's requirements and the project's context.

5.  **Execute Tasks Sequentially:**
    *   Complete each task strictly in the order presented.
    *   Use the `pew next task` command *after* successfully completing the current task to mark it done and get the next one.
    *   Do not skip any tasks or alter their prescribed order.

6.  **Milestone Completion Review:**
    *   After completing *all* tasks for Milestone `{{MILESTONE_NUMBER}}`, review the implemented work for correctness and consistency.

7.  **Completion and Next Steps:**
    *   Once all tasks for the specified milestone are successfully completed and reviewed/fixed, ask the user for the next set of instructions.

**Always remember:**
*   Stick rigorously to the plan.
*   Focus exclusively on the tasks for the specified milestone.
*   Update the task file using `pew next task` immediately after completing each task.
*   Ensure high-quality output (code, documentation, etc.).
*   Run `pew` commands autonomously as needed ("yolo mode is on").

Begin your work by reading the `{{TASK_FILE_LOCATION}}`. Then, identify and start the first task for Milestone `{{MILESTONE_NUMBER}}` using `pew next task`.

MILESTONE_NUMBER = ALL
TASK_FILE_LOCATION = .pew/tasks.md

ACT
```
